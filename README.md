# Offline series resistance correction
Performs offline series resistance correction/compensation of recorded currents based on "Traynelis SF (1998) Software-based correction of single compartment series resistance errors. J Neurosci Methods 86:25â€“34."

During whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, the resistance across the patch pipette (series resistance) can introduce considerable errors on the amplitude and dynamics of the recorded currents. While in most cases a large portion of this error can be corrected online by the patch-clamp amplifier, the remaining Rs can lead to erroneous estimation of currents. A simple software-based solution allows for the correction of the remaining Rs after the experiment (see original publication for details).
